## Tutorials

We provide several tutorials that cover the main features of the PySPOD library. 
These are organized in the form of `jupyter-notebooks`, along with their plain 
`python` implementation.

In particular, we divided the tutorials in such a way that they cover different 
functionalities of the library and practical application areas.


### Basic

#### [Tutorial Basic 1](Basic/load_data.ipynb)

#### [Tutorial Basic 2](Basic/different_approaches.ipynb)

#### [Tutorial Basic 3](Basic/post_processing.ipynb)



### Climate 

#### [Tutorial: 2D Multivariate ENSO Index](Climate/ERA20C_MEI_2D/ERA20C_MEI_2D.ipynb)

This tutorial shows how to download data from an ECMWF reanalysis dataset (ERA20C), 
and use **PySPOD** to identify spatio-temporal coherent structured in multivariate 
2D data. In particular, we seek to identify the multivariate ENSO index (MEI). 
The data is composed by the following monthly-averaged variables: mean sea level 
pressure (MSL), zonal component of the surface wind (U10), meridional component 
of the surface wind (V10), sea surface temperature (SST), 2-meter temperature 
(T2M), and, total cloud cover (TCC), on a 2D longitude-latitude grid.  


#### [Tutorial: 3D Quasi-Bienniel Oscillation](Climate/ERA20C_QBO_3D/ERA20C_QBO_3D.ipynb)

This tutorial shows how to download data from an ECMWF reanalysis dataset (ERA20C), 
and use **PySPOD** to identify spatio-temporal coherent structured in univariate 
3D data. In particular, we seek to identify the Quasi-Bienniel Oscillation (QBO). 
The data is composed by the monthly-averages of the zonal-mean zonal winds 
on a 3D longitude, latitude, pressure-levels grid.


#### [Tutorial: 2D ERA5 Mean-Sea Level Pressure](Climate/ERA5_MSLP_2D/ERA5_MSLP_2D.ipynb)

This tutorial shows how to download data from an ECMWF reanalysis dataset (ERA5), 
and use **PySPOD** to identify spatio-temporal coherent structured in univariate 
2D data. In particular, we seek to identify spatio-temporal coherent structure in 
high-resolution mean-sea level pressure data from the ERA5 dataset.



### Fluidmechanics 

#### [Tutorial: 2D Jet](Fluidmechanics/ERA20C_MEI_2D/ERA20C_MEI_2D.ipynb)




### Earthquakes 

#### [Tutorial: 2D Slip Potency](Earthquakes/ERA20C_MEI_2D/ERA20C_MEI_2D.ipynb)
