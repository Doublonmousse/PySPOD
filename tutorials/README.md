## Tutorials

We provide some tutorials that cover the main features of the
PySPOD library. These are organized in the form of `jupyter-notebooks`,
along with their plain `python` implementation.

In particular, we divided the tutorials in such a way that
they cover different functionalities of the library and practical
application areas.


### [Tutorial 1: 2D pressure fluctuations in a turbulent jet](tutorial1/tutorial1.ipynb)

This tutorial shows a simple 2D application to a turbulent jet.
The variable studied is pressure.


### [Tutorial 2: 2D total precipitation from the ERA Interim dataset](tutorial2/tutorial2.ipynb)

This tutorial shows a 2D application to climate reanalysis data from the
ERA Interim dataset. The variable studied is total precipitation, and the
aim to capture the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO).
